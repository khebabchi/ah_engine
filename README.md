# AH Engine

`ah_engine` is a game engine in its early stages, built using Rust and WGPU with simplicity in mind. This project aims to provide a streamlined and accessible foundation for developing custom game engines or high-performance applications with modern graphics rendering.

## Current Status

- **Initial Development**: The project is just getting started, and the first major milestone, the essentials/the base of `ah_app` crate, has been completed.
- **Simplicity First**: The focus is on creating a minimal and clear codebase that can be easily understood and expanded upon.

## Features (Planned)

- **Modular Design**: A simple, modular architecture that allows developers to integrate and modify components effortlessly.
- **WGPU Renderer**: Leveraging WGPU for modern, cross-platform rendering capabilities.
- **Bevy ECS**: bevy_ecs crate integration for game logic management.
- **User-Friendly**: Minimalistic design to ensure ease of learning and integration.
